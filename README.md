# 3D ArcGIS API for JavaScript

This repository contains some of the 3D [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) sessions that were shown at the virtual Esri Developer Summit 2020. The presentations are created with reveal.js, featuring interactive samples for which the source code can be found in this repository.

The full 2020 Developer Summit [technical session playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaPDDLTCmy4Ys8vfmC7DbX3FHSsyosvh7) is available on YouTube.

Urban development processes often involve large interest groups and sometimes even the citizens themselves. This is where 3D based web application play an important role, as they are accessible yet intuitive. Using a range of 3D components, such as BuildingSceneLayers, editing feature layers and analysis tools, we can build powerful yet simple to use apps that run in the browser. In this session we will look at an example use case and deep dive into the application code.
