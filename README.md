Urban development processes often involve large interest groups and sometimes even the citizens themselves. This is where 3D based web application play an important role, as they are accessible yet intuitive. Using a range of 3D components, such as BuildingSceneLayers, editing feature layers and analysis tools, we can build powerful yet simple to use apps that run in the browser. In this session we will look at an example use case and deep dive into the application code.
